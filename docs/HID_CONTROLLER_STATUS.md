# HID Controller Implementation Status

## Hardware
- **Device:** Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32S3 Sense
- **Status:** Code written, hardware setup pending
- **Blocker:** Need to master bootloader mode for uploading

## What We Built

### 1. ESP32-S3 HID Controller (`hid_controller/`)
- Complete Arduino sketch that turns ESP32-S3 into USB HID device
- WiFi server to receive commands from macOS
- Translates recordings to mouse/keyboard actions
- Uses same coordinate system as macOS recordings (85% width, 2% height)

### 2. macOS Command Sender
- C++ client to send recordings to ESP32 over WiFi
- Converts recording JSON to HID commands
- Can execute same recordings we capture in macOS app

### 3. Architecture
```
macOS App → Records actions (85%, 2%)

ESP32-S3 (WiFi Server + USB HID)
    ↓
iOS Device (AssistiveTouch)
    ↓
Real automation without jailbreak!
```

## Key Discovery
iOS accepts standard USB HID devices through AssistiveTouch - this is the breakthrough that makes local iOS automation possible without:
- Jailbreak
- Private APIs  
- App Store violations
- XCUITest limitations

## Setup Instructions (When Ready)

### ESP32-S3 Upload Process
1. Install ESP32 board support in Arduino IDE
2. Select "ESP32S3 Dev Module"
3. **Critical:** Set USB Mode to "USB-OTG (TinyUSB)"
4. To upload: Hold BOOT, press RESET, release BOOT
5. After upload, press RESET to run

### iOS Configuration
1. Settings → Accessibility → Touch → AssistiveTouch → ON
2. Connect ESP32 via USB-C to Lightning adapter (with battery power)
3. Mouse cursor should appear
4. ESP32 controls iOS through standard HID protocol

## Files Created
- `/hid_controller/esp32s3_hid_controller.ino` - Main controller
- `/hid_controller/xiao_sense_standalone.ino` - Standalone version for XIAO
- `/hid_controller/minimal_hid.ino` - Minimal test
- `/hid_controller/send_to_esp32.cpp` - macOS client
- `/hid_controller/README.md` - Detailed setup guide

## Next Steps (When Resuming)
1. Master the XIAO bootloader upload process
2. Test with iPhone + battery-powered adapter
3. Verify AssistiveTouch cursor appears
4. Send recordings from macOS to ESP32
5. Watch actual iOS automation happen

## Why This Matters
This approach finally solves iOS automation:
- Works on non-jailbroken devices
- No App Store restrictions
- Uses official iOS accessibility features
- Can run recordings captured on macOS
- True hardware-based automation

The ESP32-S3 acts as a bridge between our macOS recording system and iOS device control.
