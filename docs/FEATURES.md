## üéÆ Usage Examples

### Basic Automation
```swift
// Initialize the automation system
let automation = iPhoneAutomation()

// Detect iPhone Mirroring
automation.detectiPhoneMirroring()

// Execute a test scenario
let scenario = PredefinedScenarios.openApp
Task {
    try await scenario.execute(with: automation)
}
```

### Screenshot Capture
```swift
// Capture screenshots
let screenshotManager = ScreenshotManager()
screenshotManager.captureAllScreenshots(
    for: runningApp,
    scenarios: TestScenario.defaultScenarios
)
```

### Recording & Replay
```swift
// Start recording
recorder.startRecording()

// Perform actions...

// Stop and save
let recording = recorder.stopRecording()

// Replay later
recorder.replayRecording(recording, mode: .human)
```
